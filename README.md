  - Arrays Lab - **Objecitive: Practice indexing into arrays, strings and ASCII**  
  > Complete the implementation of scrabble.c, such that it determines the winner of a short scrabble-like game, where two players each enter their word, and the higher scoring player wins.
  - Arrays Problem sets
    1. Readability - **Objective: Practice string indexing**  
    > Design and implement a program, readability, that computes the Coleman-Liau index of the text. (what reading grade is the text)
    3. Substitution - **Objective: Practice string indexing and manipulation**  
    > Design and implement a program, substitution, that encrypts messages using a substitution cipher.
    
### 3. Algorithms - https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/weeks/3/
  - Algorithms Lab - **Objective: Understan how different algorithms work**  
  > Provided to you are three already-compiled C programs, sort1, sort2, and sort3. Each of these programs implements a different sorting algorithm: selection sort, bubble sort, or merge sort. Your task is to determine which sorting algorithm is used by each file.
  - Algorithms Problem sets
    1. Plurality - **Objective: Practice working with structures**  
    > Complete the implementation of plurality.c in such a way that the program simulates a plurality vote election.
    2. Runoff - **Objective: Practice working with structures and two dimensional arrays**  
    > Complete the implementation of runoff.c in such a way that it simulates a runoff election.
    
### 4. Memory - https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/weeks/4/
  - Memory Lab
  > Read a WAV file bit by bit and multiply the values by a given factor to increase/decrease the volume
  - Memory Problem sets
    1. Filters 
    > Iterate over each pixel of a given image and adjust the RGB values to result in a predefined effect - Blur, Sepia, Grayscale, etc.
    2. Recover
    > Read a deleted memory card (deleted pointers to the start of each file), identify the beginning of each .jpeg and write each found .jpeg into a new file.
    
### 5. Data structures - https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/weeks/5/
  - Data structures Lab - **Objective: Practice recursion and memory management with malloc/free**  
  > Complete the implementation of inheritance.c, such that it creates a family of a specified generation size and assigns blood type alleles to each family member. 
  - Data structures Problem set
    1. Speller - **Objective: Create optimal hash function to store a dictionary in a hash table** 
    > Implement, in order, load, hash, size, check, and unload as efficiently as possible using a hash table in such a way that TIME IN load, TIME IN check, TIME IN size, and TIME IN unload are all minimized.
    
### 6. Python - https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/weeks/6/
  - Python Lab - **Objective: In Python, read data from a csv file, store the data in dicts and simulate a tournament** 
  > Complete the implementation of tournament.py, such that it simulates a number of tournaments and outputs each team’s probability of winning.
  - Python Problem Sets
    1. Mario ***Solve the same problem, once again, but in Python***
    2. Cash ***Solve the same problem, once again, but in Python***
    3. Readability ***Solve the same problem, once again, but in Python***
    4. DNA ***Solve the same problem, once again, but in Python***
    
### 7. SQL - https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/weeks/7/
  - SQL Lab - **Objective: Create a number of SQL queries (fundamental ones) to answer eight questions**
  - SQL Problem sets
    1. Movies - **Objective: Create a number of SQL queries to answer eight questions** 
    > For each of the given problems, you should write a single SQL query that outputs the results specified by each problem. Your response must take the form of a single SQL query, though you may nest other queries inside of your query.
    2. Fiftyville - **Objective: Practice problem solving, writing SQL queries and JOIN tables**  
    > Given a db with 3 table, all having some piece of a riddle, write queries to drive inferences and ultimately a conclusion.
    
### 8. HTML, CSS, JavaScript - https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/weeks/8/
  - Lab - **Objective: Create a webpage allowing users to answer simple Trivia questions**
  - Problem set
    1. Homepage - **Objective: Create a simple homepage that introduces yourself, your favorite hobby or extracurricular, or anything else of interest to you.**
    
### 9. Flask - https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/weeks/9/
  - Flask Lab - **Objective: Complete the implementation of a web application to let users store and keep track of birthdays.**
  - Flask Problem set
    1. Finance - **Objective: Implement a website via which users can “buy” and “sell” stocks, keep track of their portfolio holdings and bottomline result.**
    
### Final Project  
  **Requirements**
  > The final project is your opportunity to take your newfound savvy with programming out for a spin and develop your very own piece of software. So long as your project draws upon this course’s lessons, the nature of your project is entirely up to you.
  **Short Description**  
  The application's goal is to allow dentists to send automated alerts to patients for overdue profilactic exams.  
  
  Features:
  0. Register new users
  1. Login automatically, after registration
  2. Create patient records
  3. Schedule next visits
  4. Automatically send notifications to the patient 14 days prior to the due date
  5. Have a summary for the upcoming schedule (next 14 days)
  6. See the status of the alerts for each upcoming visit

# CS50
## This repository is a collection of my course work for the CS50x Introduction to Computer Science course

### 1. C - https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/weeks/1/
  - C Lab - **Objective: Practice operators**  
  > Write a C program, which calculates the number of years required for the population to grow from the start size to the end size, given a fixed birth/death pattern
  
  - C Problem sets
    1. Mario - **Objective: Practice For loops**  
    > Write a CLI program which prompts the user for desired height and prints mario-like pyramid in the console
    2. Credit card - **Objective: Practice loops and conditional statements**  
    > Write a program that prompts the user for a credit card number and then reports (via printf) whether it is a valid American Express, MasterCard, or Visa card number, per the definitions of each’s format herein.
    
### 2. Arrays - https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/weeks/2/
  - Arrays Lab - **Objecitive: Practice indexing into arrays, strings and ASCII**  
  > Complete the implementation of scrabble.c, such that it determines the winner of a short scrabble-like game, where two players each enter their word, and the higher scoring player wins.
  - Arrays Problem sets
    1. Readability - **Objective: Practice string indexing**  
    > Design and implement a program, readability, that computes the Coleman-Liau index of the text. (what reading grade is the text)
    3. Substitution - **Objective: Practice string indexing and manipulation**  
    > Design and implement a program, substitution, that encrypts messages using a substitution cipher.
    
### 3. Algorithms - https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/weeks/3/
  - Algorithms Lab - **Objective: Understan how different algorithms work**  
  > Provided to you are three already-compiled C programs, sort1, sort2, and sort3. Each of these programs implements a different sorting algorithm: selection sort, bubble sort, or merge sort. Your task is to determine which sorting algorithm is used by each file.
  - Algorithms Problem sets
    1. Plurality - **Objective: Practice working with structures**  
    > Complete the implementation of plurality.c in such a way that the program simulates a plurality vote election.
    2. Runoff - **Objective: Practice working with structures and two dimensional arrays**  
    > Complete the implementation of runoff.c in such a way that it simulates a runoff election.
    
### 4. Memory - https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/weeks/4/
  - Memory Lab - **Objective: Read a WAV file bit by bit and multiply the values by a given factor to increase/decrease the volume**
  - Memory Problem sets
    1. Filters - **Objective: Iterate over each pixel of a given image and adjust the RGB values to result in a predefined effect - Blur, Sepia, Grayscale, etc.**
    2. Recover - **Objective: Read a deleted memory card (with deleted pointers to the start of the files), identify the beginning of each .jpeg and write each found .jpeg in a new file.**
    
### 5. Data structures - https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/weeks/5/
  - Data structures Lab - **Objective: Practice recursion and memory management with malloc/free**  
  > Complete the implementation of inheritance.c, such that it creates a family of a specified generation size and assigns blood type alleles to each family member. 
  - Data structures Problem set
    1. Speller - ***Create optimal hash function to store a dictionary in a hash table*** Implement, in order, load, hash, size, check, and unload as efficiently as possible using a hash table in such a way that TIME IN load, TIME IN check, TIME IN size, and TIME IN unload are all minimized.
    
6. Python - https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/weeks/6/
  - Python Lab - ***In Python, read data from a csv file, store the data in dicts and simulate a tournament*** Complete the implementation of tournament.py, such that it simulates a number of tournaments and outputs each team’s probability of winning.
  - Python Problem Sets
    1. Mario ***Solve the same problem, once again, but in Python***
    2. Cash ***Solve the same problem, once again, but in Python***
    3. Readability ***Solve the same problem, once again, but in Python***
    4. DNA ***Solve the same problem, once again, but in Python***
    
7. SQL - https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/weeks/7/
  - SQL Lab - ***Create a number of SQL queries (fundamental ones) to answer eight questions***
  - SQL Problem sets
    1. Movies - ***Create a number of SQL queries to answer eight questions*** For each of the given problems, you should write a single SQL query that outputs the results specified by each problem. Your response must take the form of a single SQL query, though you may nest other queries inside of your query.
    2. Fiftyville - ***Practice problem solving, writing SQL queries and JOIN tables*** - Given a db with 3 table, all having some piece of a riddle, write queries to drive inferences and ultimately a conclusion.
    
8. HTML, CSS, JavaScript - https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/weeks/8/
  - Lab - ***Create a webpage allowing users to answer simple Trivia questions***
  - Problem set
    1. Homepage - ***Create a simple homepage that introduces yourself, your favorite hobby or extracurricular, or anything else of interest to you.***
    
9. Flask - https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/weeks/9/
  - Flask Lab - ***Complete the implementation of a web application to let users store and keep track of birthdays.***
  - Flask Problem set
    1. Finance - ***Implement a website via which users can “buy” and “sell” stocks, keep track of their portfolio holdings and bottomline result.***
    
### Final Project - Here "requirements" are the result to draws upon this course’s lessons. Language, infrastructure and all kinds of tools are welcome.

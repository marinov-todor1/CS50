# CS50
This repository is a collection of my course work for the CS50x Introduction to Computer Science course

C - https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/weeks/1/
  C Lab - ***Practice operators*** Write a C program, which calculates the number of years required for the population to grow from the start size to the end size, given a fixed birth/death pattern
  C Problem sets
    1. Mario - ***Practice For loops*** write a CLI program which prompts the user for desired height and prints mario-like pyramid in the console
    2. Credit card - ***Practice loops and conditional statements*** write a program that prompts the user for a credit card number and then reports (via printf) whether it is a valid American Express, MasterCard, or Visa card number, per the definitions of each’s format herein.
    
Arrays - https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/weeks/2/
  Arrays Lab - ***Practice indexing into arrays, strings and ASCII*** complete the implementation of scrabble.c, such that it determines the winner of a short scrabble-like game, where two players each enter their word, and the higher scoring player wins.
  Arrays Problem sets
    1. Readability - ***Practice string indexing*** Design and implement a program, readability, that computes the Coleman-Liau index of the text. (what reading grade is the text)
    2. Substitution - ***Practice string indexing and manipulation*** Design and implement a program, substitution, that encrypts messages using a substitution cipher.
    
Algorithms - https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/weeks/3/
  Algorithms Lab - ***Understan how different algorithms work*** Provided to you are three already-compiled C programs, sort1, sort2, and sort3. Each of these programs implements a different sorting algorithm: selection sort, bubble sort, or merge sort. Your task is to determine which sorting algorithm is used by each file.
  Algorithms Problem sets
    1. Plurality - ***Practice working with structures*** - Complete the implementation of plurality.c in such a way that the program simulates a plurality vote election.
    2. Runoff - ***Practice working with structures and two dimensional arrays*** - Complete the implementation of runoff.c in such a way that it simulates a runoff election.
    
Memory - https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/weeks/4/
  Memory Lab - ***Read a WAV file bit by bit and multiply the values by a given factor to increase/decrease the volume***
  Memory Problem sets
    1. Filters - ***Iterate over each pixel of a given image and adjust the RGB values to result in a predefined effect - Blur, Sepia, Grayscale, etc.***
    2. Recover - ***Read a deleted memory card (with deleted pointers to the start of the files), identify the beginning of each .jpeg and write each found .jpeg in a new file.***
    
Data structures - https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/weeks/5/
  Data structures Lab - ***Practice recursion and memory management with malloc/free*** Complete the implementation of inheritance.c, such that it creates a family of a specified generation size and assigns blood type alleles to each family member. 
  Data structures Problem set
    1. Speller - ***Create optimal hash function to store a dictionary in a hash table*** Implement, in order, load, hash, size, check, and unload as efficiently as possible using a hash table in such a way that TIME IN load, TIME IN check, TIME IN size, and TIME IN unload are all minimized.
    
Python - https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/weeks/6/
  Python Lab - ***In Python, read data from a csv file, store the data in dicts and simulate a tournament*** Complete the implementation of tournament.py, such that it simulates a number of tournaments and outputs each team’s probability of winning.
  Python Problem Sets
    1. Mario ***Solve the same problem, once again, but in Python***
    2. Cash ***Solve the same problem, once again, but in Python***
    3. Readability ***Solve the same problem, once again, but in Python***
    4. DNA ***Solve the same problem, once again, but in Python***
    
SQL - https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/weeks/7/
  SQL Lab - ***Create a number of SQL queries (fundamental ones) to answer eight questions***
  SQL Problem sets
    1. Movies - ***Create a number of SQL queries to answer eight questions*** For each of the given problems, you should write a single SQL query that outputs the results specified by each problem. Your response must take the form of a single SQL query, though you may nest other queries inside of your query.
    2. Fiftyville - ***Practice problem solving, writing SQL queries and JOIN tables*** - Given a db with 3 table, all having some piece of a riddle, write queries to drive inferences and ultimately a conclusion.
    
HTML, CSS, JavaScript - 
  Lab - ***Create a webpage allowing users to answer simple Trivia questions***
  Problem set
    1. Homepage - ***Create a simple homepage that introduces yourself, your favorite hobby or extracurricular, or anything else of interest to you.***
    
Flask - 
  Flask Lab - ***Complete the implementation of a web application to let users store and keep track of birthdays.***
  Flask Problem set
    1. Finance - ***Implement a website via which users can “buy” and “sell” stocks, keep track of their portfolio holdings and bottomline result.***
    
Final Project - Here "requirements" are the result to draws upon this course’s lessons. Language, infrastructure and all kinds of tools are welcome.
